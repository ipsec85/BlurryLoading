Blurry Loading Demo

Simple project demostrates a blurred out image that comes into focus as the page 'loads' with a percentage showing and then disappearing.

Credit for the scale() function comes from August Miller on the attached Stack Overflow post. scale() 'maps' out a range of numbers between 1 to 100 between two sets of numbers.
